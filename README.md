# DjangoSRI
<strong>S.R.I.</strong> is a web scrapper I made in python and then converted it into a web app so that it could have an UI.

## How to run:
- Type: _pip install -r /requirements.txt_ 
- Type: _python manage.py migrate_
- Type: _python manage.py makemigrations_
- Type: _pytohn manage.py runserver_
- And now you will be able to access the server at <strong>http://127.0.0.1:8000</strong>
